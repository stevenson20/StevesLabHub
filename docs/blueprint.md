## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Teal (#2BC397) for a modern, techy vibe.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F7F7F8), almost white, offering a clean and distraction-free backdrop, ensuring the teal elements and code snippets pop. Note: as specified by the user request, dark mode should also be supported, as a default.
- Accent color: Light cyan (#A2EDE2), a brighter color 30 degrees to the "left" of the teal, emphasizing important interactive elements while complementing the primary hue.
- Headline and body font: 'Plus Jakarta Sans' (sans-serif) provides a balance of modernity and readability. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Monospace font: 'JetBrains Mono' (monospace) is used for code snippets to ensure clarity and readability. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use consistent and clear icons throughout the interface, with subject-based colors to differentiate categories.
- Implement a responsive layout with a maximum width of 1280px, ensuring optimal viewing on various devices.
- Use subtle animations for transitions and interactions to enhance the user experience.
